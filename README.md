## 📖 Paper Abstract
We study the modular flavor model based on the finite modular group Γ₅ ≃ A₅ with the modulus τ fixed at the symmetric point τ₀ = exp(2πi/5). At this "golden point"—a fixed point of order five—the ratios of weight-2 modular forms lie in ℚ(√5). We explicitly compute these ratios, proving they are proportional to (1, φ⁻¹, φ⁻², -φ⁻², -φ⁻¹), where φ is the golden ratio. Using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, we construct the universal Yukawa matrix M₀ and show how modular weights introduce suppression factors φ^{-(w-2)/2}, providing a natural mechanism for hierarchical fermion masses.
